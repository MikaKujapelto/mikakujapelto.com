# Mika Kujapelto
Trying out the new static website generator Phenomic by building my own website with it. It is based on React and Webpack. Whole idea of this project is pretty much to just improve my skills with React and try and learn some new stuff. I'm interested to learn more React especially. ReactJS is a JavaScript library created by Facebook. I have spend a good amount of time learning more about React but I have always have liked the project based approach to learn new stuff. 

Mika Kujapelto is a <a href="http://www.mikakujapelto.com/" title="Front End Developer" target="_blank">Front End Developer</a> from Finland currently living and working in Malta. I work as a Senior Front End Developer (SEO) for Catena Media. I'm most known for my skills with Wordpress but I'm always eager try and learn new stuff as well. If you would like to follow him checkout his personal site where he occasionally blogs or follow him on Twitter (@Juutti)

## Getting started
Getting started with Phenomic is pretty easy. However I do not using this as your base for the Phenomic site that you're planning to launch. It is a pretty nice platform for blogging and you can create your posts using markdown which I prefer over text editors or html as writing is much faster with markdown. 

### Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Run development server

```sh
npm start
```

The development server will start at http://localhost:3333/ and the dev server uses live reload which is pretty smooth. 

### Build for production

```sh
npm run build
```

Build script will run and your static website will be generated and is available at dist/.

## Deploy
I use Amazon S3Â as you can also host static websites there. You can simply upload the new version to the bucket you have created for your website using the AWS Cli tool. Amazon is also pretty affordable solution and it also has a lot of other options that can be added to the project in the future, if necessary. 

Of course feel free to use whatever you want. Static site is super easy to deploy wherever you just choose to deploy it! 

## Using this repo for your own project
I don't recommend using this for your own project as a base but of course you can if you wish. However it is a better idea to go to <a href="https://phenomic.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Phenomic.io</a> and checkout how you can setup your own project and also get the latest version. Im just testing this for myself basicly!!!
